Test::Builder
=============

This is a flexible framework for building TAP test libraries.

It provides the basic "building blocks" and generic functionality needed for building your own
application-specific TAP test libraries.


Source Code
===========

The source code for Test::Builder is available at <https://github.com/soh-cah-toa/p6-test-builder>.

To obtain a local copy of the source code, run:

    git clone git://github.com/soh-cah-toa/p6-test-builder.git p6-test-builder


Installation
============

Once you've obtained a copy of the source code, run:

    ufo             # Creates Makefile
    make            # Builds module
    make test       # Runs test suite
    make install    # Installs to ~/.perl6/lib

If you wish to remove the files generated during the build/install process, run:

    make clean        # Removes generated files
    make distclean    # 'make clean' and removes Makefile
